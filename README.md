Dataset-based Implementation- 

Use Python-based APIs and perform the following three classes of activities.

EDA
1. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis to gather insight from the dataset. Write your inference about the analysis learned from visualizations (minimum 3)

Classification
CLASSIFICATION (any of the Logistic Regression / SVM / Decision Tree/ Na√Øve Bayes/KNN/ANN). Justify your design choices at each step: Write as a markdown cell in Jupyter Notebook at the beginning of each subsection.
1. Perform and explain necessary pre-processing/feature engineering on this dataset
2. Perform the Machine Learning activity. Explain the choice of target attribute, classification type, and model selected with the reason
3. Quantify and explain the quality of your ML model. Explain the choice of evaluation metric
4. Your observation about the results (Hint: comment on the problem statement and conclude the effectiveness of the machine learning activity)

Regression
Any of the Linear Regression (any Gradient / Stochastic / MiniBatch)/linear basis models/KNN/Locally weighted regression/ any of the regularization techniques). Justify your design choices at each step: Write
as a markdown cell in Jupyter Notebook at the beginning of each subsection.
1. Perform and explain necessary pre-processing/feature engineering on this dataset
2. Perform the Machine Learning activity. Explain Attributes of interest, Regularization type with reason, and model selected with reason 
3. Quantify and explain the quality of your ML model. Explain the choice of evaluation metric 
4. Your observation about the results (Hint: comment on the problem statement and conclude the effectiveness of the machine learning activity)

Ensemble ML
Justify your design choices at each step: Write as a markdown cell in Jupyter Notebook at the beginning of each subsection.
1. Perform and explain necessary pre-processing/feature engineering on this dataset
2. Perform the Machine Learning activity. Explain Attributes of interest, base classifier chosen with reason, model selected with reason
3. Quantify and explain the quality of your ML model. Explain the choice of evaluation metric
4. Your observation about the results (Hint: comment on the problem statement and conclude the effectiveness of the machine learning activity)
