Dataset-based Implementation- 

Use python based APIs and perform the following three classes of activities.

EDA
1. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis to gather insight from the dataset. Write your
inference about the analysis learned from visualizations (minimum 3)

Classification
CLASSIFICATION (any of the Logistic Regression / SVM / Decision Tree/ Na√Øve
Bayes/KNN/ANN). Justify your design choices at each step: Write as a
markdown cell in jupyter notebook at the beginning of each subsection.
1. Perform and explain necessary pre-processing / feature engineering on this dataset
2. Perform the Machine Learning activity. Explain the choice of target attribute,
classification type, model selected with reason
3. Quantify and explain the quality of your ML model. Explain the choice of
evaluation metric
4. Your observation about the results (Hint: comment on the problem statement
and conclude the effectiveness of the machine learning activity)

Regression
Any of the Linear Regression (any of Gradient / Stochastic /
MiniBatch)/linear basis models/KNN/Locally weighted regression/ any of
the regularization techniques). Justify your design choices at each step: Write
as a markdown cell in jupyter notebook at the beginning of each subsection.
1. Perform and explain necessary pre-processing / feature engineering on this dataset
[0.5]
2. Perform the Machine Learning activity. Explain Attributes of interest,
Regularization type with reason, model selected with reason 
3. Quantify and explain the quality of your ML model. Explain the choice of
evaluation metric [1.5]
4. Your observation about the results (Hint: comment on the problem statement
and conclude the effectiveness of the machine learning activity)

Ensemble ML
Justify your design choices at each step: Write as a markdown cell in jupyter
notebook at the beginning of each subsection.
1. Perform and explain necessary pre-processing / feature engineering on this dataset
2. Perform the Machine Learning activity. Explain Attributes of interest, base
classifier chosen with reason, model selected with reason
3. Quantify and explain the quality of your ML model. Explain the choice of
evaluation metric
4. Your observation about the results (Hint: comment on the problem statement
and conclude the effectiveness of the machine learning activity)
